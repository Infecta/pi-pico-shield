# Disclaimer

- I am by no means someone who is knowledgeable when it comes to PCB design. This is my first ever design that has actually been produced.
- This board was meant as a drop-in replacement for the Yuancon/[Roxy](https://github.com/veroxzik/roxy-board) but due to [oversights](./repo_images/board_issue.png) the board did was not long enough to align to the screw standoffs.

# Production

Gerbers are stored in the `_prod` folder of the repo as `gerbers.zip`

In JLCPCB you can pretty much get away with the default options offered by the site. Im not sure about other PCB manufacturing services so do your research.


(I don't have proper time for crediting people in this README at the moment)
